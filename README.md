# machine-learning-intro
Repository used for my initial explorations into Machine Learning

Initial study and online course work was done in a private repro for a hobby project, the "winter bot project". I will make this seperate repository just to focus on the studying Machine-Learning

#TODO
 - Create an general purpose Library for Machine Learning and Data Science from the learnings and notes of the online courses, traning exercises (kaggle, open-ai) and books
