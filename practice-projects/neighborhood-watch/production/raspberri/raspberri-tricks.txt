    https://garywoodfine.com/shared-folder-raspberry-pi-windows-8/

    i) install samba on pi
        apt-get install samba samba-common-bin

    ii) Set a password for your user in Samba (tip, use the same as the linux user: pi (pass:3))
        sudo smbpasswd -a <user_name>

    iii) Create a directory to be shared
        mkdir /home/<user_name>/<folder_name>

    iv) Edit the samba config file
        iv.a) first make a backup:
        sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf ~

        iv.b) add the new shared folder config
        sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

        Once "smb.conf" has loaded, 

            We need to enable WINS support, so  Change
                wins support = no

            To enhance the network performance, set TCP_NODELAY
                uncomment: socket options = TCP_NODELAY

            add this to the very end of the file:

                [<folder_name>]
                path = /home/<user_name>/<folder_name>
                browsable = yes
                valid users = <user_name>
                read only = no

    v) restart samba
        sudo service smbd restart

    vi) run test to check if conf is in good format
        testparm

     -- To access it --
        To access your network share
            sudo apt-get install smbclient
            # List all shares:
            smbclient -L //<HOST_IP_OR_NAME>/<folder_name> -U <user>
            # connect:
            smbclient //<HOST_IP_OR_NAME>/<folder_name> -U <user>

        To access your network share use your username () and password through the path "smb:////" (Linux users) or "\\\" (Windows users). Note that "" value is passed in "[]", in other words, the share name you entered in "/etc/samba/smb.conf".

            Note: The default user group of samba is "WORKGROUP".

        - OR -
            Within Windows Explorer try \\YourHostName\YourShareName, or from the Linux file manager try smb://YourHostName/YourShareName.
