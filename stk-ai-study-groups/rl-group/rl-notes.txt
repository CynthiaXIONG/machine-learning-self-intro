    --- Markov Chain ---
        -> stochastic processes
        . Set of possible states: S = {s0, s1, ..., sm}
        . Initial state: s0
        . Transition Model: T(s, s')
            -The future state, s', is determined only by the current/present state, s, (independent from previous states)
            - T can be defined by a transition matrix, where the values are the probablity of ending up in state s', from the current state s
            - The initial state of T at k=0 can be extrapolated to determined the k-step transition probablity (by the k-th power of the T)
                k-step_transition_prob = T^k  (snippet_1 -> rl-notes.py)
            - The vectors of the matrix represent the probability of staying in that state
        . Initial distribution: v, state of the system at k=0
        . The state probability after k-steps = Dot(v, step_transition_prob)
        . After n-steps the state probablity distribution can converge to equilibrium, independently of the starting distribution (but this not always happens)

    --- Markov Decision Process - MDP ---
        -> Markov chain based with the inclusion of an Agent and a Decision making process
        . Set of possible states: S
        . Initial state: s0
        . Set of possible actions: A
        . Transition Model: T(s, a, s')
        . Reward function: R(s)

        . T represents the probability of reaching s', from s if action 'a' is taken
        . R is a real value from the agent moving to s0

        -> Problem: maximise the reward, avoind states which return negativas values and choosing the ones which return positive values
        -> Solution: find the policy PI(s) which return s the action with the highest reward

        . PI* -> optimal poloty, which retuns the highest expected reward/utility

    --- Bellman Equation ---
    -> problem: how to choose the best policy? how to compare policies?
    . U: utility is the instant reward from state 's', plus the possible max rewards of future states  (utility is also known as Value)
        -> Disconted Rewards:  U = R(s0) + γ*R(s1) + γ^2R(s2) + .... + γ^n*R(sn)
            γ: [0:1] discount factor -> preference of the agnt for the current rewards over future rewards
        
        -> Bellman Equation: U(s) = R(s) + γ*max_a(sum(T(s,a,s') * U(s')))
            . action with the maximum sum of the utility of the possible subsequent states * the probability of getting to those subsequent states s'

        . For 'n' possible states there are 'n' Bellman equations. If the Bellman Eq was linear, this would be easily solved, but it is not (because of the MAX!!)
            -> Solution is an iterative approach

        -- Value Iteration Algorithm --
            . the Bellman Eq is the iteration algorithm to solve a MDP
            . find the utility/value for each state, through an iterative approach
                i. start with arbitary values (0)
                ii. Bellman Update: calculate the utility of a state and update it
                iii. updating will converge to equilibrium (only reached in the inf iteration)
                iv. stop updating when convergion from one iteration to the next is very small
                    ||U(k+1) -U(k)|| <  ϵ * (1 - γ) / γ  
                    . ϵ: stopping criteria value
                    

        -- Policy Iteration Algorithm --
            . find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward, PI*
            . for a given action, a, evaluate this policy utility/value, using the Bellmans Eq (but without the need for iterating the actions to find a max, because we want the utility for a selected "policy action")
            . policy improvement: improve policy with the action that returns the best utility
            . 


        -- Value VS Policy --
            . Choose Policy iteration if:
                -many actions
                -start from a fair policy
            . Choose Value:
                -few actions and transition is acyclic
