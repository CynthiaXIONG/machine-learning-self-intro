---Market Mechanics---

- order: 
	. buy or sell - to buy or to sell
	. symbol - id of share (BTC, GOOG, etc)
	. num_shares - num of shares!
	. limit or Market - 
		market -> accept the price the market is bearing. no price is specified (the best possible)
		limit -> the order has price limit (need to specify a price)
	. price - only for limit orders, represents the limit the price can get to

	example: "BUY,IBM,100,LIMIT,99.95", "SELL, GOOG, 150, MARKET"

- order_book:
		- BID: want to buy
		- ASK: want to sell
	. orders are registered by the "order" they arrive

-How Hedge Funds exploit the market mechanics-
	. Hedge funds have colocated computers on the physical stock exchanges, and can match a order much faster than the usual customer


-Selling Short-
	. you "sell short" if you believe the price will go "down"
	. order implemented by the "broker" and not by the stock exchanges
	. we are selling stock we don't own...

	#Entry# -> you "loan" shares from a holder, and sell it to a buyer
				. results in you cashing the money the buyer payed you, but 
				now you "owe" that amount of shares to the original holder

	#Exit# -> you "exit" by buying the shares that you owned and give it back to the original holder

	. you make profit if you sold at an higher price than you bought back (the price went down)
	. the "danger" is if the price goes up, for you to exit, you will lose money!!
