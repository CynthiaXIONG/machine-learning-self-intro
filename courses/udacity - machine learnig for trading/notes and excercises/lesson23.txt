---Assessing Learning Algorithms---

-Root Mean Squared Error RMS-
	. RMSE = sqrt(sum((y_test - y_predict)**2) / n)

-Methodology to test Data-
	. one_trial: 	->60% of data use to train, and test with 40% rest
					->Measure RMSE (of test data)

	. cross_trials: ->split data into chunks, e.g: 5 chunks
					->use 60-80% of chunks to train and the remaning to test
					->switch around the chunks and preform more trials!

					->#NOTE#: never have test data from a time before the training data,
					because this is "peaking into the future"!!
						-> Dont use all the chunks at the same time, but always keep the chronological order

-Correlation-
	. Measure the correlation between the predicted and the real values (y_predict vs y_test)
	. use numpy function "np.corrcoef()" -> outputs value [-1, 1]:
			-> 1, strongly correlated, GOOD
			-> -1, inversely correlated, BAD
			-> 0, not correlated at all, BAD

#Note#: As RSM error increase, correation decreases
