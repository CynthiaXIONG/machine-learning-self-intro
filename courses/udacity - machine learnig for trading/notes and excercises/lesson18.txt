---Efficient Markets Hypothesis, EMH---
-assumptions-
    . large number of investors looking to make profit
    . new external information arrives randomly and markets react quickly by investors
    . prices adjust quickly

. information: where does it come from?
    . price/volme: public, quick to access -> bases for techical analysis
    . fundamental data: reported quarterly, public, more related to the value of the company
    . exogenous: information about the world that affects the company (e.g:price of oil)
    . company insiders: secret, but could be game changer

-3 forms of the EMH-
    .weak: future prices cannot be predicted by analizing historical prices (but predictions can be made with fundamental info)
    .semi-strong: prices adjust rapidly(instantanously) to new public information (fundamental info not good also, only inside info might help us)
    .strong: prices reflect all information, both public and private (fuck, no room to make predictions and make money)


--IS THE EMH CORRECT--
    . If it is, then we cant beat the market
    . So we hope #it IS NOT# (but the "weak" form is more true than strong)
