---How Edge Funds use CAPM---

--using CAPM to calc espected portfolio return--
. if we have model that predicts both alpha and beta correctly for the stocks
. we allocate the weights for each portfolio stock allocation
    . positive -> long (holding/buying)
    . negative -> short (short selling)
. we calc "rp" with CAPM
    -> rp = sum_i(w_i * (beta_i*market_ret + alpha_i))

    assume we can predict alpha and beta, but:
     . becase market_ret is not predictable, beta*market_ret is unreliable
        . if we can make beta for the portfolio = 0 (by suming all bethas_i*wieghts with positive and negative wieght values (longs vs short) ),
            we can eliminate market RISK
        . and we should sell short the ones with negative alpha and buy long with positive alpha
    SUMMARY:
        -> minimize market risk ->beta_port = 0 
            by selecting the correct weights (long buy and short sell )
        -> short sell on alpha negative and buy on positive to have positive portfolio return
