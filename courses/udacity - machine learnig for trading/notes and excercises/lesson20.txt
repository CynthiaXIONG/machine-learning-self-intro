---Portfolio Optimization---

	. covariance: how a stock varies in relation with another
		. Its possible to mix stocks in a Portfolio that have positive return 
			but their variation is the oposite ("anti-covariation")
			so its cancels each other out -> lower the average std 
				->Portfolio has LOWER RISK than any individual stock

-Mean Variance Optimization _ MVO-
	-> optimizer that mixes stocks with anti-covariation so their mean variation is lowered

	- #inputs#
		. expected_return:
		. volatility: std
		. covariance: matrix between each stock and any other stock their relation)
		. target_return:
	- #outputs#
		. assets_weights: for the Portfolio that minimize the risk for the target return

	note: Efficient Frontier -> Theoretical limit for a Portfolio risk-return
