---Law of Active Portfolio Managemnt---

- grinolds_law: performance = skill * sqrt(breadth)  => IR = IC * sqrt(BR)
	performance -> IR (infomation ratio)
		IR = mean(alpha_port) / std(alpha_port)  ->sharpe ratio of return using only the alpha component (excess return)
	skill -> IC (infomation coeficient, skill for making a single pick)
		IC = correlation of forecasts to returns  (value [0-1])
	breath -> BR (how many trading opportunities we have)
		BR = trading opportunities per year

--Analogy with Coin Flipping--
. flip coins instead of stocks
. the coin is biased (e.g "alpha" 0.51 heads, so slight more change of getting heads)
. uncertainty is like "betha"

	bettingsimulation: bet N coins ->win: get 2*N, lose: get 0
	. 1000 tables available
	. 1000 tokens available
	. all 1000 coin flipping games run in parallel and simultaniously

	2 bet:
		. a) 1000tokens on 1 table only
		. b) 1 token per table (1000 tables)

	->"a" is more risky than "b", excepted return is the same as "b", but risk(std) is 30times larger than "b)"
	shaper_ratio: sr_a = 20 / 30 = 0.63 | sr_b = 20 / 1 = 20
	-> Option "b" is a clear winner (much less risk for the same excepted return)

	note: sr_b = sr_a * sqrt(1000)  (like performance)

	#summary"
	-> higher alpha = higher shaper_ratio
	-> shaper_ratio grows with sqrt(breath)
	-> #easier to increase breath then skill#
