---Technical Analyses---
. only analyses "price and volume" (instead of earnings, dividens, cash flow etc... <- "fundamental factors")
. statiscis on price and volume -> "indicators" (are "heuristics" that hint for a buy or sell)

--Effictiveness--
. "individual" indicators are weak predictores
. "combination of indicators" with machine learning could be very strong
. look for "constrats" (if certain stocks behave differently from market) <- this is worth a further look
. techincal analyses work better for "shorter time periods" (milliseconds, seconds, trades on the same day)
. fast decisions, but easy decisions (not complex) -> good for compute driven trading

--Some techincal Indicators--
-Momentum-
	. over a short perior (could be some days), how much has the price changed
	. correspondes to the "m" of two points chosen the the selected period of time
	-> momentum[t] = price[t]/price[t-n] - 1  (momentum for day 'y' for the period of days 'n')

-Simple moving avarage SMA-
	. simple avarage over the certain window of time (see previos class)
	. #SEE LESSON 5 -> Rolling Mean
	. when the price crosses the rolling mean, could be a signal -> "SMA Cross"

-Bollinger Bands-
. #SEE LESSON 5 
	. limits placed at + and - 2*std (standard deviation) from the SMA
	. If price crosses back those bands (was out and moving back to the SMA),
		then its a good signal for buy/sell


--Normalization--
. this factor must be normalized for machine learning

 -> normed = (values - mean) / values.std()
