---Dealing with DATA -> Historical Price and Volume---

. there can be 100.000 transactions per second...how to manage so much data?
	-> consulidate this "tick data" into minute/hour/day chunks
		-> chunks data: OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE, VOLUME  <- for the specific time interval

NOTE:
	. stock_split: if stock price is too high (that can make buying just one stock to pricey), split the stocks (1 stock of 100 -> 2 stocks of 50)

	. Dividends:
		. The money paid buy the company per share per year.
		. When dividens are anounced, the price just before the dividend is in action goes up to meet this extra value,
 	when the dividend is in effect it will move back

#ADJUSTED_CLOSE#: The price of the CLOSE using today's share split and dividends change correction.
	. This way we can check past data without reading it wrong (misreading a stock split with a big price drop)

. Note: 
	 Survivor Bias -> if you pick historic data, try to pick data that has the stocks that "died" and
	 					not just the ones that made it through till the present
	 					#Use survivor Bias Free Data#
