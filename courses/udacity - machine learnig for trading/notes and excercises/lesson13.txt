---Value of a Company---
. The "stock price" can be different than the "real value" of a company (speculation, etc)
	. if stock price > true value (selling oportunity) and vice versa

-Real Price Estimation-
	. intrinsic_value: the value of the company dividens (how much you make per your per share) divided by the discont rate
		. Discount rate -> how much interest rate does the company pays you over the dividends (the less trusty a company is, the higher is must offer to be desirable)
			. = dividends / discount_rate

	. book_value: = total_assests_of_the_company (except intagible assets) minus liabilities  
		. intagible_assets -> patents, and other things hard to price
		. liabilities -> loans
		. eg: total_assets = 40, intagible_assets= 15, liabilities = 10, book_value = 40 - 10 = 30

	. market_capitalization: = num_shares * Price
		. value is determined by the market
