---Capital Asset Pricing Model - CAPM---

. NOTE: Market portfolio -> a "symbolic" portfolio that represents the market, 
			where the weight of each stock allocation is proportional to the company market capitalization value
	e.g: "SP500" -> index that representes the top 500 companies in the US

-CAPM-
-> r_i(t) = β_i*r_m(t) + α_i(t)

	r_i -> return on a particular day
	r_m -> return of the market on a particular day
	β_i -> beta of the stock on a particular day, 
		=> slope(m) = β, represents how reactive a stock is to the market (SPY)
	α_i -> alpha of the stock on a particular day
		=> intersection with 0 (b) = α, if positive, means that this stock has better performance than market(SPY)

		α and β -> see lesson 7, Scatter Plots from the difference between the daily returns of two values (two 'stocks') 

-CAPM vs Active Management-
	. passive: buy index (from the market portfolio) and hold
	. active: pick stocks (and use different weights from the market portfolio, can be 0, or even negative (selling short))

	. CAMP-> passive managers believe α is "0" or very close to it (but is "random"...)
	. Active managers-> believe that α can be predicted and taken advantage of!

-according_to_CAPM-
. because alpha is random, we can only "beat" the market by using good betas
 -> chose high β in up markets (gain more)
 -> chose low β in down markets (lose less)
. but it also says that you can predit the market, stock

!CAPM SAYS YOU CANT BEAT THE MARKET!
