    . One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
        A trick when you want to flatten a matrix X of shape (a,b,c,d) to a matrix X_flatten of shape (b ∗∗ c ∗∗ d, a) is to use:
            X_flatten = X.reshape(-1, X.shape[0]).T
